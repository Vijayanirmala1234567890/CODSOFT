Task 3: Image Captioning
Combining computer vision and natural language processing to create an image captioning AI. 
The solution involves using pre-trained image recognition models such as VGG or ResNet to extract features from images. 
These features are then fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model to generate descriptive captions for the images.
